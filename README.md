# Zambian infant studies data
Repository holding data for the Zambian infant studies (ZIS) analyzed by the Johnson Lab. All data files are labeled by study and include metadata and raw counts data in the form of a Summarized Experiment object nested within a Multi-Assay Experiment object. Please talk to Brie if you need help properly extracting the data. You will also need to perform additional manipulation to transform the data to genus-level or log CPM.
